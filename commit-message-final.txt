CRITICAL FIX: Perplexity prompt + Enterprise validators

Fixed job-discovery-agent.ts Perplexity prompt bug:
- Changed from 'web_search tool' (doesn't exist) to 'site: operators' (works)
- Removed CLICK/visit instructions (Perplexity can't do that)
- Added validation for Confidential companies and listing pages

Created 4 enterprise-grade validators:
- email-validator.ts: Rejects fake/disposable emails
- company-validator.ts: Rejects UNKNOWN/Confidential companies
- job-validator.ts: Rejects listing pages, validates all fields
- data-sanitizer.ts: Sanitizes all data before database

Files modified:
- src/lib/agents/job-discovery-agent.ts (lines 93-157)
- src/lib/validators/email-validator.ts (NEW)
- src/lib/validators/company-validator.ts (NEW)
- src/lib/validators/job-validator.ts (NEW)
- src/lib/validators/data-sanitizer.ts (NEW)

Build status: SUCCESS (0 errors)
