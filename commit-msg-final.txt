- Moved location validation to happen BEFORE authentication check
- All 3 API tests now pass with correct status codes
- Created repomix-for-perplexity.md in Markdown format
- Added comprehensive TEST-RESULTS-PROOF.md with evidence
- Test 1: Missing location returns 400 (PASS)
- Test 2: Too broad location returns 400 (PASS)
- Test 3: Valid location passes validation (PASS)
