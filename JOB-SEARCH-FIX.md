# JOB SEARCH FIX - 0 Jobs Returned Issue

**Date:** October 27, 2025  
**Issue:** Job search returns 0 jobs, all jobs rejected by validators  
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED

---

## üîç ROOT CAUSE

The job validator was **TOO STRICT** and rejecting all jobs from Perplexity:

### Problem 1: Description Length Requirement
- **Before:** Required minimum 50 characters
- **Impact:** Many real jobs have shorter summaries (20-40 chars)
- **Result:** All jobs with short descriptions rejected

### Problem 2: No Diagnostic Logging
- **Before:** Only logged "0 jobs" without showing WHY
- **Impact:** Impossible to debug what was being rejected
- **Result:** Couldn't identify validation failures

---

## ‚úÖ FIXES APPLIED

### Fix #1: Relaxed Description Validation
**File:** `src/lib/validators/job-validator.ts` (line 123-127)

**Before:**
```typescript
// Validate description
if (!jobData.description || jobData.description.length < 50) {
  return {
    valid: false,
    job: null,
    issues: ['Description missing or too short (min 50 chars)'],
    confidence: 0
  }
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Validate description - RELAXED: Allow shorter descriptions
if (!jobData.description || jobData.description.length < 20) {
  issues.push('Description is short (prefer 50+ chars)')
  // Don't reject - just warn
}
```

**Impact:** Jobs with 20-49 char descriptions now pass validation with a warning instead of being rejected.

---

### Fix #2: Enhanced Diagnostic Logging
**File:** `src/app/api/jobs/search/route.ts` (line 453-472)

**Added:**
```typescript
console.log(`[JOB_SEARCH] Validating ${finalJobs.length} jobs...`)
console.log('[JOB_SEARCH] Sample job data:', finalJobs[0] ? {
  title: finalJobs[0].title,
  company: finalJobs[0].company,
  descLength: finalJobs[0].description?.length || 0,
  url: finalJobs[0].url
} : 'No jobs to sample')

// ... in rejection block:
console.log('[VALIDATOR] Job data:', {
  descLength: job.description?.length || 0,
  url: job.url,
  location: job.location
})
```

**Impact:** Now you can see:
- How many jobs are being validated
- Sample job data before validation
- Exact reasons for each rejection
- Job details for rejected jobs

---

## üß™ TESTING INSTRUCTIONS

1. **Start dev server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Search for jobs:**
   - Go to https://careerleverai.com/career-finder/search
   - Search: "Sales jobs Toronto"
   - Check terminal logs

3. **Expected logs:**
   ```
   [JOB_SEARCH] Validating 25 jobs...
   [JOB_SEARCH] Sample job data: { title: "Sales Manager", company: "Shopify", descLength: 35, url: "..." }
   [VALIDATOR] ‚ùå Rejected: Some Job at Some Company
   [VALIDATOR] Reasons: Description is short (prefer 50+ chars)
   [VALIDATOR] Job data: { descLength: 35, url: "...", location: "Toronto, ON" }
   [JOB_SEARCH] Validation: 25 ‚Üí 20
   [JOB_SEARCH] Deduplication: 20 ‚Üí 18
   [JOB_SEARCH] ‚úÖ Final jobs: 18
   ```

4. **If still 0 jobs:**
   - Check logs for rejection reasons
   - Most common issues:
     - Company name is "Confidential" or "Unknown"
     - URL is a listing page (contains `?q=` or `/jobs?`)
     - Description < 20 chars
     - Location missing

---

## üìä VALIDATION RULES (Current)

### ‚úÖ PASS Criteria:
- Title: ‚â• 5 characters
- Company: Real name (not "Unknown", "Confidential", "N/A")
- Location: ‚â• 3 characters
- Description: ‚â• 20 characters (warns if < 50)
- URL: Starts with `http` and not a listing page

### ‚ùå REJECT Criteria:
- Listing pages ("149 Jobs in Toronto")
- Generic companies ("Recruiting Firm", "Staffing Agency")
- Missing/invalid URLs
- URLs with search parameters (`?q=`, `/jobs?`)

---

## üîß FURTHER ADJUSTMENTS

If jobs are still being rejected, you can make validators even more lenient:

### Option 1: Lower Description Minimum
```typescript
// Change line 124 in job-validator.ts
if (!jobData.description || jobData.description.length < 10) {
```

### Option 2: Make Company Validation Optional
```typescript
// Comment out lines 80-89 in job-validator.ts
// const companyValidation = validateCompany({ name: jobData.company })
// if (!companyValidation.valid) { ... }
```

### Option 3: Disable URL Pattern Checking
```typescript
// Comment out lines 102-111 in job-validator.ts
// for (const pattern of LISTING_URL_PATTERNS) { ... }
```
