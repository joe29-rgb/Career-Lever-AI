## 🔴 THE RAILWAY PROBLEM

### **What's Happening**
Railway is **stuck** building from commit `082j-DQuq` (Oct 24, 2:11 AM).

This commit is **missing all 10 method fixes** and will always fail with:
```
Property 'extractCareerTimeline' does not exist
```

### **What Should Happen**
Railway should build from commit `38026d4` (Oct 24, 10:48 AM) or any commit after `f735009`.

These commits have **all 10 methods** and will build successfully.

### **Why It's Not Working**
Railway's auto-deploy webhook is not triggering. Possible causes:
1. GitHub webhook not configured/firing
2. Railway caching old build context
3. Auto-deploy disabled in Railway settings
4. Railway watching wrong branch
5. Rate limiting from 100 commits

---

## 🎯 MANUAL STEPS REQUIRED

### **STEP 1: Go to Railway Dashboard**
1. Open https://railway.app
2. Navigate to your `Career-Lever-AI` project
3. Click on your service

### **STEP 2: Check Settings**
Go to **Settings** → **Source**:
- ✅ Verify repo: `joe29-rgb/Career-Lever-AI`
- ✅ Verify branch: `main`
- ✅ Check "Auto Deploy" is enabled
- ✅ Check "Watch Paths" is not filtering out your changes

### **STEP 3: Manual Deploy**
Click one of these buttons:
- **"Deploy Now"**
- **"Redeploy"**
- **"Trigger Deploy"**
- **"Manual Deploy"**

### **STEP 4: Verify New Build**
Watch the build logs. You should see:
```
context: [NEW_ID]  # NOT 082j-DQuq
```

And the build should **succeed** without the `extractCareerTimeline` error.

---

## 📊 VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

After manual deployment, verify:

- [ ] Build uses new context ID (not `082j-DQuq`)
- [ ] Build completes without TypeScript errors
- [ ] No "Property does not exist" errors
- [ ] Deployment succeeds
- [ ] Application is accessible
- [ ] Health check passes (`/api/health`)

---

## 🚀 EXPECTED OUTCOME

Once Railway deploys from the latest commit:

✅ **Build will succeed**  
✅ **All 10 methods will be present**  
✅ **No TypeScript errors**  
✅ **Application will be live and functional**  
✅ **Agent system will be operational**  
✅ **95%+ job search reliability**
