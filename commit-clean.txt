Clean repository - All work complete without OpenJDK

Removed OpenJDK-25 folder (135MB Java runtime - not needed)
This is a Node.js/TypeScript application, not Java

All work from previous sessions included:
- 11 new code files (validators, constants, agents, types)
- 2 modified files
- 14 documentation files
- Build: SUCCESS (0 errors)
- All tests passing

Ready to push to GitHub without file size issues
