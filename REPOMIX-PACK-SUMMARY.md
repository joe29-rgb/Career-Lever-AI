## 🔍 Why Files Are Missing

### Possible Reasons:
1. **Never Created** - Files were planned but not implemented
2. **Different Names** - Files exist with different names/paths
3. **Consolidated** - Logic was merged into other files
4. **Deleted** - Files were removed in previous commits

### What This Means:
The codebase is less complete than expected. Many features mentioned in the requirements may not be implemented yet, or they're implemented differently than documented.

## 💡 Recommendations

### To Get Missing Files:
1. **Search for similar files:**
   ```bash
   find src -name "*scraper*"
   find src -name "*job*"
   find src/components -name "*.tsx"
   ```

2. **Check if logic is consolidated:**
   - Scraper logic might be in `advanced-scraper.ts`
   - Job processing might be in `perplexity-intelligence.ts`
   - Types might be inline or in different locations

3. **Create missing files if needed:**
   - Implement individual scrapers
   - Create orchestrator agent
   - Add data processing utilities

## 📝 Summary

**Requested:** 26 files  
**Found:** 8 files (31%)  
**Missing:** 18 files (69%)  

**Status:** ⚠️ Partial pack created with available files

The repomix contains the core Perplexity intelligence and our recent fixes, but many supporting files don't exist in the codebase. This suggests the project is less complete than documented, or files are organized differently than expected.
