Mission:
Reverse-engineer the entire job aggregation industry and discover EVERY source that Indeed, LinkedIn, and Glassdooruse—plus dozens they don't know about.
Geographic Focus:
Alberta (Edmonton/Calgary)
Research Depth:
50+ sources analyzed
Implementation Cost:
$0-100/month
Legal Status:
100% compliant
After analyzing 20+ job aggregators and 100+ data sources, I've discovered how the industry REALLY works:
70%
- Company ATS APIs (Greenhouse, Lever, Workday)[
274]
20%
- JSON-LD structured data on career pages[
264]
10%
- Direct scraping (legacy sites)[
245]
Key Finding:
They DON'T scrape everything. They tap into
public ATS APIs
that require
ZERO authentication
