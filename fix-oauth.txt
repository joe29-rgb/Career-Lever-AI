GOOGLE OAUTH FIX INSTRUCTIONS
=============================

ERROR: redirect_uri_mismatch
This means Google doesn't recognize your callback URL.

SOLUTION:
1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
2. Select your OAuth 2.0 Client ID
3. Add these Authorized redirect URIs:

   FOR PRODUCTION (Railway):
   https://job-craft-ai-jobcraftai.up.railway.app/api/auth/callback/google
   
   FOR LOCAL DEVELOPMENT:
   http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google

4. Click SAVE

VERIFY YOUR RAILWAY URL:
- Check Railway dashboard for actual URL
- Update NEXTAUTH_URL in .env.local if different
- Redeploy after changing environment variables

COMMON ISSUES:
- URL has trailing slash (remove it)
- HTTP vs HTTPS mismatch
- Wrong domain name
- Missing /api/auth/callback/google path

After fixing, sign in should work immediately (no code changes needed).
