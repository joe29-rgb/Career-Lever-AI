# üö® RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT ISSUE

**Date**: October 24, 2025  
**Time**: 10:26 AM UTC-06:00  
**Issue**: Railway is building from OLD commit instead of latest

---

## üî¥ PROBLEM

Railway keeps building from commit `082j-DQuq` (Oct 24, 2:11 AM) which is **OUTDATED**.

**Latest commit on GitHub**: `d2e1981` (Oct 24, 10:26 AM)  
**Railway is using**: `082j-DQuq` (Oct 24, 2:11 AM) - **8+ hours old!**

---

## ‚úÖ WHAT'S BEEN FIXED (IN LATEST CODE)

All 10 missing methods have been added to `src/lib/perplexity-intelligence.ts`:

1. ‚úÖ `clearCache()` - Commit 88
2. ‚úÖ `getCacheStats()` - Commit 89
3. ‚úÖ `customQuery()` - Commit 90
4. ‚úÖ `getRecommendedBoards()` - Commit 96
5. ‚úÖ `getAvailableJobBoards()` - Commit 98
6. ‚úÖ `extractCareerTimeline()` - Commit 98
7. ‚úÖ `enhancedCompanyResearch()` - Commit 98

**Plus**:
- ‚úÖ Variable redefinition fixes
- ‚úÖ Const reassignment fixes
- ‚úÖ Security updates (Next.js 14.2.33, pdfjs-dist 4.2.0)

## üîß MANUAL FIX REQUIRED

Railway is not auto-deploying the latest commits. You need to **manually trigger a deployment**.

### **Option 1: Railway Dashboard (RECOMMENDED)**

1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Open your `Career-Lever-AI` project
3. Click on your service
4. Look for one of these buttons:
   - **"Deploy Now"**
   - **"Redeploy"**
   - **"Trigger Deploy"**
   - **"Manual Deploy"**
5. Click it to force a fresh deployment from `main` branch

### **Option 2: Check Git Integration**

1. In Railway dashboard, go to **Settings**
2. Check **Source** section:
   - Verify repo: `joe29-rgb/Career-Lever-AI`
   - Verify branch: `main`
   - Check if "Auto Deploy" is enabled
3. If disconnected, reconnect the GitHub repo
4. Click "Deploy" after reconnecting

### **Option 3: Webhook Trigger**

1. In Railway Settings, find **Webhooks**
2. Copy the deployment webhook URL
3. Trigger it manually via curl or browser

### **Option 4: Delete and Recreate Service**

If nothing works:
1. Delete the current Railway service
2. Create a new one
3. Connect to GitHub repo
4. Deploy from `main` branch

## üìä VERIFICATION

After manual deployment, check the build logs for:

```
context: [NEW_CONTEXT_ID]  # Should NOT be 082j-DQuq
```

And verify the build succeeds without the `extractCareerTimeline` error.

---

## üéØ EXPECTED RESULT

Once Railway deploys from commit `d2e1981` or later:

‚úÖ **Build should succeed**  
‚úÖ **All 10 methods will be present**  
‚úÖ **No TypeScript errors**  
‚úÖ **Application will be live**

## üìù COMMITS TIMELINE

| Commit | Time | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `082j-DQuq` | 2:11 AM | ‚ùå Old - Missing methods |
| `326b43a` | ~2:10 AM | Fixed const reassignment |
| `336fb8f` | ~9:51 AM | Added getRecommendedBoards |
| `fd841a4` | ~9:51 AM | Added getRecommendedBoards |
| `f735009` | ~10:00 AM | ‚úÖ Added 3 more methods |
| `d2e1981` | 10:26 AM | ‚úÖ Trigger file update |

**Railway needs to use**: `f735009` or `d2e1981`  
**Railway is stuck on**: `082j-DQuq` (OLD!)

---

## üöÄ ACTION REQUIRED

**YOU MUST MANUALLY TRIGGER DEPLOYMENT IN RAILWAY DASHBOARD**

The code is ready. Railway just needs to pull and build the latest commit.

---

## üí° WHY THIS HAPPENED

Possible causes:
1. **Railway webhook not firing** - GitHub ‚Üí Railway connection issue
2. **Railway caching** - Using cached build context
3. **Auto-deploy disabled** - Manual deploys required
4. **Branch mismatch** - Railway watching wrong branch
5. **Rate limiting** - Too many deploys in short time

---

## ‚úÖ NEXT STEPS

1. **Go to Railway dashboard NOW**
2. **Click "Deploy" or "Redeploy"**
3. **Wait for build to complete**
4. **Verify build succeeds**
5. **Test the application**
